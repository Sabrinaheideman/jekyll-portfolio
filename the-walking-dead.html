  <h1 class="tena">the walking dead logo animation</h1>
  <p class="text">You can probably tell by now that I’m obsessed with zombie related things. So of course, I had to make a logo animation of The Walking Dead. The logo is used like a window to see into the world of the walking dead. The city rises up and then the zombies. I used a red theme because the show can be very gruesome at parts. I also added a grunge to make the logo look worn.</p>
