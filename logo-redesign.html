  <h1>logo redesign</h1>
  <p class="text">This is a redesign of a logo from a small local florist shop called Roses Are Us. I did this on my own time, independently from the company. This is my concept on how to improve their logo. The vase that holds the roses is a U which represents “us” and the roses that are intertwined represent love and passion; therefore, the icon is connected to the name, Roses Are Us. The R and O are connected in Roses to help make the word flow nicely and adds to it to make it more unique.h</p>
