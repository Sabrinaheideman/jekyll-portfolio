  <h1 class="tena">the last of us</h1>
  <p class="text">I created an advisement for the popular video game, The Last of Us, using a parallax effect. I wanted to show the bond between the two main characters, Ellie and Joel, and some of the stuff they have to deal with during the game. The game has a strong story line and is intense which is why I thought this image fits best.</p>
