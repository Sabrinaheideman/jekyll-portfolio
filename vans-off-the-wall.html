  <h1 class="tena">Vans Off The Wall</h1>
  <p class="text">I did a brand identity video on Vans Off the Wall. For this video, I wanted to focus on the athletic lifestyle of the brand because they sponsor a lot of sporting events. First, you’ll see the environment in which you could find someone wearing Vans, then the gear that they sell for that sport and lastly the action shots!</p>

    <p class="space micro">Disclaimer: I did this on my own time, independently from the company and I do not own any of the footage/audio for this video. I just mashed it all together like mashed potatoes.</p>
