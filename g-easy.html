  <p class="text">After I did my first typography portrait I wanted to make another one but with colour. This one is of an artist named Gerald Gillum (stage name is G-Easy). I really wanted to experiment with colour for this piece to see how far is too far. The midnight blue and the deep gold ending up being the perfect match to balance each other. The gold colour is used for the title to make the image and text support each other as well. A line is in the middle of it to create a unique title and how the line is running off the page it looks like a ribbon on a present holding it altogether.</p>
