  <h1 class="tena">winners campaign</h1>
  <p class="text">The objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability to think creatively with original concepts and capture a target audience’s attention through message and design. The client for this project is WINNERS, a department store that offers fabulous for less.
    <br>I wanted to do something different, that you don’t see much of for fashion ads and that is illustrations and not models. A faceless model will capture the audience’s attention; they will be looking at the colours and style of the clothing and not get distracted by the model. I’ve narrowed it down to three popular styles: hipster chic, street casual and vintage spring fashion.</p>
