  <h1 class="tena">Separate Pvris</h1>
  <p class="text">The concept behind this piece of artwork is to create a typography portrait. The person in the portrait is the lead singer of my favourite band Pvris (pronounced like Paris). I used a word map of lyrics from their song called Separate and placed it repeatedly over the canvas until I was satisfied. The title is in a tall compressed sans serif font to contrast the serif font that makes the artwork. I only used black and white because the band never strays from this two colours. Plus, the black of her jacket really stands out in the mess of the type.</p>
